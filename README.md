# Portable Apps
These apps are meant to be very lightweight and portable and used within demos to show various code samples and functionality. They're meant to be stateless and easy to understand.

## NodeJS Apps

1. Address Book - This uses the FakeJSON API to make requests to a dummy API for fake data. This app supports a webui running on HTML with Embeded Javascript AND a simple NodeJS API for getting in a text format. There's also the ability to make bulk requests for stress testing the app. This will make one API request for data and then store that data in a file and reply with the data stored in the file. Checkout the README.md in the folder for more details.
